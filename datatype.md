# Introduction

## 1. Data type

in this section we will talk about data type and why we should use def type of data and in main what is data used for.

## 1.1. Integers

Integers are whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.

## 1.2. Floats

Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.

## 1.3. Strings

A string is a sequence of characters surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

## 1.4. Complex numbers

Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:

## 2. Comments

Comments can be used to explain Python code.

Comments can be used to make the code more readable.

Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

## 2.1. single line comment

Comments starts with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:

## 2.2. multi line comment

You can have comments that span multiple lines by using a pair of three quotes, either ''' or """.

## 3. variable

A variable is a container for a value, which can be of various types.

## 4. Boolean

Boolean represents one of two values: True or False.

## 5. Print

The print() function prints the specified message to the screen, or other standard output device.

## 6. Python operators

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Arithmetic operators | Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations: | x + y |
| Assignment operators | Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables: | x = 5 |
| Comparison operators | Comparison operators are used to compare two values: | x == y |
| Logical operators | Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements: | x < 5 and  x < 10 |
| Identity operators | Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location: | x is y |
| Membership operators | Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object: | x in y |
| Bitwise operators | Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers: | x & y |
