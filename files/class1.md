## 1. What is Django?
  <!-- 

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.
-->
## 2. What is Django project?
  <!-- 


A Django project is a collection of settings for an instance of Django, including database configuration, Django-specific options and application-specific settings.

## 3. What is Django app?

  <!-- 

A Django app is a Web application that does something – e.g., a Weblog system, a database of public records or a simple poll app. Each app can have multiple models (usually – one per object type), multiple views and multiple templates. An app can be in multiple projects.

## 4. What is Django view?
  <!-- 


A view is a “type” of Web page in your Django application that generally serves a specific function and has a specific template. You might define a Web page listing all questions in your database, another Web page showing a particular question and its responses, and another Web page for voting on a particular question. Each of these would be an example of a different view.

## 5. What is Django URL?
  <!-- 


A URL is a Web address. URLs are how you navigate the Web. They are what you type into your browser’s address bar to get to a particular Web page. Django uses URLs to determine what code to execute in each view.

## 6. What is Django template?


A template is a text file that your Web application uses to dynamically generate HTML. Templates can inherit from other templates, and can include bits of generated HTML called “template tags”. Templates can also include other templates, which allows you to build up a collection of reusable components (e.g., a standard header or footer for your site).
